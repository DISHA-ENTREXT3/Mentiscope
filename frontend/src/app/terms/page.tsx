    <LegalLayout title="Terms of Service" lastUpdated="February 5, 2026">
      <h2>1. Architecture Usage</h2>
      <p>
        By initializing a synchronization link with Mentiscope, you agree to these Terms of Protocol. Our platform provides predictive intelligence; however, all action items and strategies should be implemented with parental discretion.
      </p>

      <h2>2. User Obligations</h2>
      <p>
        Users must provide accurate neural baselines for the most effective mapping. Attempting to bypass the security architecture or reverse-engineer the neural engine is strictly prohibited.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Subscription Systems</h2>
      <p>
        Neural plans are billed on a recurring cycle. Access to premium 9-dimensional deep sweeps is contingent upon active protocol subscription. Entrext Labs reserves the right to modify pricing with prior uplink notification.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        The Mentiscope neural engine, branding, and all intelligence cache content are the exclusive property of Entrext Labs. User-generated data remains the property of the parent, subject to our processing protocols.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        Mentiscope is a supportive architecture. We are not responsible for academic or behavioral outcomes resulting from the implementation of intelligence action items.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        Users may terminate their synchronization at any point. Termination results in the immediate sunsetting of premium dashboard access.
      </p>
