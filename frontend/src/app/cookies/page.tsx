      <h2>1. Tactical Storage</h2>
      <p>
        Mentiscope uses &quot;cookies&quot; and similar tactical storage nodes to maintain your synchronization baseline and optimize your interaction with the neural architecture.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Types of Nodes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Structural Cookies:</strong> Essential for maintaining your secure link and authentication state.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytical Nodes:</strong> Helping us understand how parents navigate the architecture so we can refine the UX.</li>
        <li><strong>Preference Tags:</strong> Saving your theme selections and dashboard configurations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Integration</h2>
      <p>
        We utilize trusted third-party nodes like Firebase for secure authentication and Google Analytics for platform optimization. These nodes follow their own encrypted protocols.
      </p>

      <h2>4. User Calibration</h2>
      <p>
        You may modify your node preferences through your browser&apos;s security settings. Note that disabling essential structural cookies may result in protocol failure and broken links within the dashboard.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Deep Sweep Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        We do not use cookies for invasive cross-platform tracking. Our node usage is strictly focused on optimizing the Mentiscope experience for your family.
